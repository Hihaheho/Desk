# (Draft) Introduce Desk: the future of coding

- Finally I, as a founder of Hihaheho Studio, released the first demo of software called Desk. In this post, I introduce Desk.

TODOs
- [ ] Write a description about Desk X and Desk-plugins
- [ ] Write a clear difference between Desk-plugins and existing applications
- [ ] Add a section about problems of current world to solve
- [ ] Add a screenshot of Desk
- [ ] Add a sample program of Desk-lang
- [ ] Add a roadmap with target users
- [ ] Add features of the first release

## TL;DR

Desk is:
- a reinvention of Excel to fascinate both hackers and gamers.
- a reinvention of Smalltalk environments but with a functional and statically typed language.

## Related buzzwords (actually I don't like buzzwords).

- **Codification** (like **Datafication**)
- **Code-oriented** (like **Data-oriented**)
- **HighCode** (like **NoCode** and **LowCode** but fully programmable)
- **CodeVerse** (like **Metaverse**, by *Desk Verse*)
- **Digital Transformation** (by *Desk Robot*)
- **Web 2.1** (Everything is a code and hosted. Can we beat **Web 3.0**?)
- **Code Divide** (like **Digital Divide**)
- **Platform as a Service** (How about **Code as a Service**?)
- **Gamification**
- **Hyper-Customization** (like **Hyper-Personalization**)
- **Desk-Apps** (like **Hybrid-Apps**)
- **Big Code** (like **Big Data**)
- **DevOps**
- **Digital Disruption** (Yes, we'll make it!)

## Goals

- Make every software programmable
  - Make products open to users
  - Desk is embeddable in any software
- Blur the line between living and coding
  - Make programming more easy and funny and pragmatic
  - Make top boards of people's desks into touch panel displays that run Desk

## What's Desk?

### Desk is:

- A cyberpunk application platform
	- In the future, we plan to create a touch panel table top that runs Desk.
- A coding environment for the next 100 years
	- It blurs the line between living and coding.
- A reusable open-source software
	- It's permissive open source and consists of simple pieces of code.

### Desk is not:

- Operating System
	- It's like an operating system for a desk, but it's a bevy of reusable components. Any software can use Desk internally for any purpose!
- Node-based or block-based and mouse-powered programming tool
	- Nodes and blocks are easy but not simple. In Desk, you touch a real AST! It embraces not only mouses but also keyboards (and we are building a new keyboard called *Berry3060*).
- A pile of magic
	- It's magical, but it's not magic. Magic is constructed by a bunch of complex magic circles and spells. Unlike this, the whole Desk and every part of it are always simple!

## Philosophy

To achieve the goals, we have design philosophies.

- Intuitive like games
  - Desk X is built on a game engine.
- Pragmatic like professional tools
  - Desk-lang is like a professional language such as python or Haskell
- Versatile like spreadsheet
  - Desk-lang is designed for any purpose
- Minimalist design
  - Everything is minimalistic and written in simple codes.
- Accessible to everyone
  - We don't forget about accessibility to make programming available to everyone.

## Stories of me and Desk

- [2008] I started programming when I was around ten years old. It looks exciting to me.
- [2016] I want to create something like Minecraft.
- [2018] As a core of my game engine, I designed and created [Cizen](https://github.com/Hihaheho/Cizen); then it's used for [Online Experiment System](https://xee.jp).
- [2020-2021] I'm struggling with non programmable products.
- [2021] I used Elixer for data processing, and I want more visualization.
- [2021] I used Google Sheets, and I want more programable.
- [2021] Also I think the programming is too hard and esoteric.
- [2021] I've got a big picture of Desk.
