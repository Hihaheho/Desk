## Goal and philosophy

🎯 **We want to make top boards of people's desks into touch panel displays that run Desk.**

- 🎮 **Intuitive** like games
- 🥼 **Pragmatic** like professional tools
- 🗺️️ **Versatile** like spreadsheet
- 💗 **Accessible** to everyone
- 🛹 **Minimalist** design

## Why Desk?

Desk apps (applications built on Desk) are inherently:

- 🎼 **Data-oriented**
- 🔒 **Statically-typed** (data and UI)
- 🤖 **Programmable** (extensible by code)
- 🧲 **Interoperable** with other Desk apps
- 📱 Running on **everywhere** (web, desktop, mobile)

## How does it work?

Desk is powered by several systems:

- Desk Programming Language (Desk-lang)
- Desk Kernel (dkernel)
- Desk Editor
- Desk VM (DVM)
- Desk Compiler (deskc)
- Desk Window Manager (DeskWM)
- and so on ...

### Desk Programming Language

Desk-lang is a programming language which has:

- Minimalistic syntax and semantics
- Type system with inference
- Algebraic effects
- Content-addressable by type and UUID

Any data and programs on Desk apps are finally evaluated as snippets of Desk-lang.

### Desk Kernel

Dkernel is a platform-agnostic environment for writing and running Desk-lang. Functionalities and UIs of Desk apps are made up by syscall of Dkernel.

Dkernel provides these features:

- File system for Desk-lang
- Permission management system
- Realtime collaboration support
- 🚧 Package management system
- 🚧 Version control system

🚧 not yet implemented

### Other systems

- Desk Editor provides 🚧 type-driven UI for Desk-lang
- DVM provides 🚧 incremental computation
- Deskc provides 🚧 incremental compilation
- DeskWM provides 🚧 3D/2D rendering with meshes

🚧 not yet implemented

## Is it any good?

Yes.
