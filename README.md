The application platform for your cyberpunk desk.

## Why Desk?

Desk apps (applications built on Desk) are inherently:

- 🎼 **Data-oriented**
- 🔒 **Statically-typed** (data and UI)
- 🤖 **Programmable** (extensible by code)
- 🧲 **Interoperable** with other Desk apps
- 📱 Running on **everywhere** (web, desktop, mobile)

## How does it work?

Desk is powered by **Desk Programming Language** and **Desk Kernel**.

### Desk Programming Language

Desk programming language (Desk-lang) is a programming language which has:

- Minimalistic syntax and semantics
- Type system with inference
- Algebraic effects
- Content-addressible by type and UUID
- Embeddable interpreter
- 🚧 Compiler for performant binary

Any data and programs on Desk apps are finally evaluated as snippets of Desk-lang.

### Desk Kernel

Desk kernel is a platform-agnostic environment for writing and running Desk-lang. Functionalities and UIs of Desk apps are built by using syscalls of the kernel. It's using [Bevy Engine](https://bevyengine.org/) and [egui](https://www.egui.rs/#demo).

Desk kernel provides these features:

- 🚧 File system for Desk-lang
- 🚧 Type-driven UI components
- 🚧 Incremental computation engine
- 🚧 Realtime collaboration support
- 🚧 Package management system
- 🚧 Version control system
- 🚧 Permission management system
- 🚧 3D/2D rendering with meshes

## Philosophy

- 🎮 Intuitive like games
- 🥼 Pragmatic like professional tools
- 🗺️️ Versatile like spreadsheet
- 💗 Accessible to everyone
- 🛹 Minimalistic design

## Goal

We want to make top boards of people's desks into touch panel displays that run Desk.

## Is it any good?

Yes.
